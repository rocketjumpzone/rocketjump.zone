<h1 class="w3-center">Xonotic Competitive Edition Fund</h1>
<p class="w3-center">
Our mission is to create a competitive version for already running <a href="/hall-of-fame">Esports scene</a> partnered with <a href="https://zensports.com">ZenSports</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/flukkzmedia/">Flukkz media.</a><br>
We truly believe we can build an epic Arena FPS Esport.

## What's this Esport?
Since May 2021 we started hosting Xonotic tournaments partnered with ZenSports.  
We've hosted so far 10 Duel and 3 2v2 TDM cups with a prize money over 7K plus various giveaways.  

It's a perfect opportunity for new players to get into our Esport and earn nice money.  
*(don't let <a href="/player/dodger">Dodger</a> win everything, KAPPA)*

## What we need - New Assets
The current Xonotic game is pretty outdated (released 4 years ago), we want to update it and make it more appealing for new players.

+ **Weapon Models:**
&nbsp;<kbd>Blaster,  Shotgun, Electro, Vortex, Devastator, LG (ARC)</kbd>  
*but possibly we will do all models to keep the same design concept*

+ **Mega Armor, Mega Health Models**

+ **Player Model**

+ New main menu theme (lower priority)

### We've already started - New Devastator Model
this is a very early, work in progress devastator model

## What we also want
+ a web server browser (join a server directly from the web)
+ a ranking system + matchmaking

<hr>


## Q&A

+ **How much money do you need?**  
Our goal is 2K eur, the more we get the more we can invest in for the game.

+ **How long is it gonna take to make a release?**  
Within a few weeks we will release a stable release and continue adding new assets.

+ **Why not make it for Xonotic itself?**  
Last release was 4 years ago and we have no control over it. We also wouldn't be able to add features suitable for Esports.  
We can ensure you all new assets will be back-ported to official Xonotic.
