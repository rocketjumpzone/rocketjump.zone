## What's already done for XCE and in General

+ In game Medals
+ New Duel scoreboard
+ New HUD
+ New teamplay score panel
+ Flagger (displays the player's country flag)
+ New sound pack
+ Player profiles (integrated with rocketjump.zone)
+ Discord bot (game integration - chat and match results)
+ A web server browser (rocketjump.zone/browser)
+ Premade configs

<hr>

## What we need - New Assets

+ **Weapon Models:**
&nbsp;<kbd>Blaster,  Shotgun, Electro, Vortex, Devastator, LG (ARC)</kbd>  
*but possibly we will do all models to keep the same design concept*

+ **Mega Armor, Mega Health Models**

+ **Player Model**


## Q&A

+ **How much money do you need?**  
Once we get a donation we use it.. the more we get the more we can invest in for the game.


+ **Why not make it for Xonotic itself?**  
Last release was 4 years ago and we have no control over it. We also wouldn't be able to add features suitable for Esports.  
We can ensure you all new assets will be back-ported to the official Xonotic game.
