## New map - Canal for Xonotic (Work in Progress)
Remember this map? It's a very unique map for Xonotic. Original idea by Ch4mp. Main layout created by t0uYK8Ne and Cortez, now picked by ballerburg9005 to finish it for good.  
Could this map replace stormkeep? What do you think?

## Prodeus Tournaments
We will be also hosting tournaments for Prodeus in 2023. After the duel tourney we are excited for a 2v2 TDM tournament:

It's good to take a break from "Quakish games" and play something else once in a while, what do you think?
