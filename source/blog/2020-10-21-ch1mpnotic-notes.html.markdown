<hr>

## What is Ch1mpnotic?
Ch1mpnotic is gonna be a new arena shooter, a fork of **Xonotic**. The game will be exclusively competitive duel and main arena shooter to run rocket jump zone tournaments.

We know that a high skill game doesn't attract many players, especially when it's an arena shooter. Our goal is not to get as many players as possible but rather a bigger audience.
