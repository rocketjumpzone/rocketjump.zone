<h2 class="w3-center" id="seeds">What does Higher and Lower Seed mean?</h2>
<img src="../../images/seed.png" alt="Seed">

**Higher Seed:** in this case is team crybabies, just because **their seed is higher**  
**Lower Seed:** in this case is team StrngDram, just because **their seed is lower**  

Let's take an example in a Best of 3 game (Bo3) which is usually ban (H) ban(L) pick(H) pick(L) ban(H) ban(L) tiebreaker  

H - Higher Seed  
L - Lower Seed  

So team crybabies are higher seed (H), which means they ban a map first, then team StrngDram are lower seed (L) which means they ban a map second. Then Higher Seed (H) picks a map, Lower Seed (L) picks a map and if it's 1:1 the remaining map will decide who takes the series.
