<h2 class="w3-center">When does the tournament start in my timezone?</h2>
<p class="w3-center">
<a href="https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/" target="_blank">worldtimebuddy.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://timee.io/" target="_blank">timee.io</a>

<h2 class="w3-center">A player profile at rocketjump.zone</h2>

<p class="w3-center">Make sure to register for a <a href="https://rocketjump.zone/new-player" target="_blank">player profile</a> before attending your first tournament.<br>It's to track your achievements, winnings and you will also get a new discord role - Competitor.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">How to check in and report match results?</h2>
<p class="w3-center">We use challonge as our tournament platform. Usually check in opens 30 minutes before tournament start, so you can either use discord and tell us that you're ready to play or check in via Challonge. The same applies for reporting match results.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">Player names</h2>
<p class="w3-center">We suggest using one player name everywhere - in game name (optional), discord name (must match), profile name (must match)</p>

<h2 class="w3-center" id="seeds">What does Higher and Lower Seed mean?</h2>
<img src="../../images/seed.png" alt="Seed">

**Higher Seed:** in this case is team crybabies, just because **their seed is higher**  
**Lower Seed:** in this case is team StrngDram, just because **their seed is lower**  

Let's take an example in a Best of 3 (Bo3) which is usually ban (H) ban(L) pick(H) pick(L) ban(H) ban(L) tie  

H - Higher Seed  
L - Lower Seed  

So team crybabies are higher seed (H), which means they ban a map first, then team StrngDram are lower seed (L) which means they ban a map second. Then Higher Seed (H) pick a map, Lower Seed (L) pick a map and if it's 1:1 the remaining map will decide who takes the series.
